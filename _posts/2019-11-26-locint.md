## **Summary**
This data science capstone project deals with the process of leveraging location data acquired from data providers such as Foursquare to explore the neighborhoods within a targeted city and create clustering models. Using K-means cluster, similar locations with minimum distance shall be grouped into clusters. It is the simplest form of unsupervised machine learning algorithm and it helps in grouping similar data points. Utilizing this model, I intend to create a solution for small scale business start-ups who are exploring ideal locations to establish their small scale business in an urban locality.

## **Introduction**
In this capstone project, I will be using the data that was scraped online for Toronto City and use the data along with the Foursquare API to address the business challenge of identifying an ideal location to establish a local cafe with maximum client coverage. For this purpose, I would need to identify localities or boroughs that are firstly densely populated and which have minimum number of cafe services in order to avoid competition.

## **Project Objectives**
Identify an ideal business location for a cafe startup by considering areas/localities/boroughs that
 - High frequency of office and colleges in the neighborhood
 - Low frequency of cafes in the localities/boroughs
