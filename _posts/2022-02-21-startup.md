## **Summary**
The Government of India launched its flagship program of "Startup India Initiative" in the year 2016 with an aim to support budding enterpreneurs and build a robust startup ecosystem that could India into a job creating nation. Under this program, multiple corporates and government agencies work together to bridge gaps and build connections with the startups. 

## **Introduction**
The "Startup India Initiative" was launched on 16th January, 2016 with the objective to support the business growth in the country. Under the initiative the government established 3 important pillars of support:
- Simplification and Handholding where the government has eased the processes of business compliance, exit process due to failure, acquiring legal counsel, fast tracking patent applications and easy access to information through comprehensive knowledge sharing and communication
- Funding & Incentives that provide exemptions on Income Tax and Capital gains, access to seed funds and credit guarantee schemes and establishment of fund of funds to infuse requisite capital into the startup ecosystem.
- Incubation & Industry Academia Partners that lead to creation of innovation labs, events, competitions and grants.

## **Project**
### **About Dataset**
This is a ![Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/simple-exploration-notebook-indian-startups/data) shared publicly. This data covers the different startups that have come up across India with information regarding the industry type, investor details and amount of investment (in USD).

### **Data Analysis Approach**
The preliminary aim of using this data was to acquire basic insight into the coverage of the startups in India and understand the key industries that have successfully acquired funding for thier business development. Using Tableau Public I have built a story that examines the spread of the startups across India and the scope of investment within the industry sector. ![Business Startup Scenario in India](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/veena.muralidharan/viz/BusinessStartupsScenarioinIndia/BusinessStartupsinIndia#1)
