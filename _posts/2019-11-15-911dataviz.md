### Summary
Using Python to explore the emergency call patterns made to 911. Moreover, using Bokeh library to create a visualization dashboard to view the call patterns according to the emergency types.

### Dataset
[Kaggle Dataset: 911 Emergency Calls](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert)

### Exploring the data
A preliminary review of the data indicates that the 911 emergency calls are categorized into Medical, Fire and Traffic Emergencies. Looking at each category, we are able to derive the topmost reasons or emergency incidents that have caused these calls. The most common calls were related to medical emergencies with **Fall Victims (10%) and Respiratory Attacks (10%)** being the most common call types. In case of fire emergencies, the most common calls were related to **fire alarms (38%)** that were raised while Traffic emergencies include **Vehicle Accidents (64%)** as the most common reported calls.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to create an interactive visualization dashboard using Bokeh- An interactive Python visualization library that provides an elegant view of the data and offers high level interactivity.
