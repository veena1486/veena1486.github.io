With over 10 years in the GIS industry, I excel in advanced surveying, mapping technologies, and leveraging complex data for strategic business development.

Proficient in Geostatistics, ArcGIS, QGIS, R, and Python, I've led projects mapping disease prevalence, healthcare facilities, and LiDAR data classification for utility sectors.

I'm passionate about data-driven processes that strengthen operations and project execution. As a Geospatial Data Scientist, I deploy machine learning models to provide unique geographic insights for business development.
