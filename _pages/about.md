Hello there!!

I have been working in the GIS industry for about 10 years now...give or take! Being in this industry for so long has taught me how to work with advance survey & mapping technologies as well as on the use of complex data to generate insights that favour business development. 

Equipped with the knowledge of Geostatistics and subsequesnt GIS tools such as ArcGIS, QGIS as well as analytic softwares like R & Python, has led me to work in varied projects ranging from mapping disease prevalence & healthcare facilities for Public Healthcare Research to performing LiDAR classification of data for Utility Sectors. 

Being in the sector of data generation and analytics for so many years has made me a firm believer in the possibilities and potential of good data driven processes that help in building strong operations and project execution capabilities. 

I love getting my hands dirty with data. Armed with analytical tools along with the knowledge and experience of working with complex data types within my industry has led me to my calling of becoming a **Geospatial Data Scientist**. Like every data scientist, I have been working with machine learning models- Regression, Classification, SVM, Random Forests etc for over a year now. But with the added advantage of my domain knowledge, I am able to provide another dimension of insight related to our geography that opens doors to various other possibilities in business development.

In my spare time, I love writing about new technology and analytical methods within my domain. I believe that it is essential to share and transfer knowledge to sustain continous growth and so I write. I have experience of creating blog content, research articles, white papers as well as proposal documents for my niche. 

You can check out some of my personal [projects](https://veena1486.github.io/projects/) and [blogs](https://veena1486.github.io/). You can also visit my [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veena-muralidharan-0765191b/) page to view more content.

Don't hesitate to connect with me if you are interested to collaborate or need support in applying GIS capabilities to your data science projects or just to create more interesting technical content/write-up for your projects/products.

If nothing else, then we can meet up for coffee and throw around some wonderful ideas on the use of Spatial Data Science in AI and Machine Learning that could help our community in the future.
