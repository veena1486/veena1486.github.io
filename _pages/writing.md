## - **Field Testing of Alternative Cookstove Performance in a Rural Setting of Western India** 
*Feb 3, 2015 | International Journal of Environment Research and Public Health* <br>
Indoor Air Pollution has been silent killer over the years. We do not realise of its existence, but it continues to affect our health which causes long term illnesses and puts a burden on our delicate health systems. Rural village households continue to remain the most affected due to their continued use of Traditional Cookstoves within the four walls of their houses. The most affected individuals are the women and children aged below five, as they continue to be exposed to **Indoor Particulate Matter (PM2.5)** which has a long term effect on their lungs. This article is a research on comparing traditional cookstoves to the improved cookstoves that are being marketed to the rural community.<br>
